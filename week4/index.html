  <h2>Week 4</h2>
  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <h4>Forms</h4>
  <p>Tip to make the forms more user-friendly: use the <i>placeholder</i> attribute, it is useful to give the user hints to fill out the form.</p>
  <p>Study the list of attributes that can be used to make forms more user-friendly.</p>
  <p>It is important to use the correct input field, for example, use a <i>password</i> input field instead of a <i>text</i> input field if I want the user to enter a password.</p>
  <h4>OOP</h4>
  <p>There are many benefits to object-oriented programming, for example, using the same functionality for multiple objects, or inheriting attributes and characteristics from one object to a new object.</p>
  <p>Remember that names for class declarations are capitalized.</p>
  <p>It is recommended to use arrow functions in callbacks because they do not have their own <i>this</i> context.</p>
  <h4>Modules</h4>
  <p>There are many advantages using modules, they make the code more organized, and it makes it easier to obtain the functionalities that we want for our program.</p>
  <p>The code in a module should have a single purpose.</p>
