  <h4>Client-side form validation</h4>
  <p>If I want the user to have a good experience I must use form validation, a great advantage of doing so 
    is that when incorrect data is found the user can quickly fix it.</p>
  <p>Validation done in the browser is called <i>client-side validation</i></p>
  <p>Examples of form validation feedback:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Please enter your phone number in the format xxx-xxxx" (A specific data format is required for it to be considered valid).</li>
    <li>Please enter a valid email address" (the data you entered is not in the right format).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I can validate user data without JavaScript, this is done by using validation attributes on form elements. 
    For example: <i>required</i>, <i>minlength</i> and <i>maxlength</i>. 
    This is called <i>Built-in form validation</i></p>
