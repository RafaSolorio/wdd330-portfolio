  <h2>Week 5</h2>
  <h3>Notes</h3>
  <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program.</p>
  <p>System error ― a problem with the system or external devices</p>
  <p>Programmer error ― incorrect syntax or faulty logic in the program</p>
  <p>User error ― errors from the user</p>
  <h4>Exceptions</h2>
  <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program
     to deal with the error. It will produce a stack trace, a sequence of functions that lead to the point 
     where the error occurred</p>
  <h4>Warning</h4>
  <p>A warning occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash, 
    it can be problematic</p>

  <p>I should ensure that my code fails loudly so I can identify any errors and fix them. This is achieved 
    by making exceptions. I can also use strict mode</p>
  <p>If I suspect a piece of code will result in an error I can use a try block,  if an exception occurs it 
    will pass the error object that is thrown onto a catch block.</p>
