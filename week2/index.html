  <h3>Notes:</h3>
  <p>I must have the habit of making comments in my programs, it is something that I don't do often 
    but I must give it more importance since it makes the programs easier to read.
  </p>
  <p>Hard equality (===) should always be used when comparing values in a program to avoid problems.</p>
  <p>If I write a block of code more than once I have to turn it into a function, 
    it will make my job easier (The DRY principle).</p>
