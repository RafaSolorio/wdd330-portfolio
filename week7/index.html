  <h4>Functions </h4>
  <p>Functions are <i>first-class objects</i> (they can be passed around in the same way as every other
     value and they can have properties and methods themselves, like objects)</p>

  <h4>Promises</h4>
  <p>A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation.</p>
  <p>I think promises are a useful tool because they help simplify the process in a program</p>
  <p id="list">The phases of a promise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pending phase (waiting the results of an operation). </li>
    <li>Then the promise is settled.</li>
    <li>Then if the promise has been settled it may have been resolved or rejected</li>
  </ul>
